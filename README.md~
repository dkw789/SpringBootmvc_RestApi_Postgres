Challenge 1:
Create  web service to add a method to store text passed from the form into the database using MVC design pattern. In addition to saving the text, store the date and time when the when the data was saved.

Challenge 2: Include the user info

Extend the form from challenge 5 to capture the user name and a list of all the submissions by user. Add another method to the service to return all text submissions and display them at the bottom of the page.

Challenge 3: Replying to text

Extend your solution from challenge 6 to allow “responding” to already posted texts and display responses, indented, below the related text entry.

As always, extend your unit tests.

Challenge 4: Capture more data

Capture user’s location (user enters the city) on the form. For every post, include city, city’s latitude and longitude and current temperature. Display this information on the form, next to each post.

Challenge 5: Secure your application with https

Add https capability to the solution to challenge 8.
